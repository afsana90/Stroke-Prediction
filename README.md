Stroke Prediction dataset
Dataset Description:
The Stroke Prediction Dataset contains health and demographic features to predict
stroke risk. Key attributes include age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, average glucose level, BMI, and a binary target variable indicating strokeoccurrence. It's useful for analysing risk factors associated with strokes. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke- prediction-dataset/data
Objective Identification:
The objective of the Stroke Prediction Dataset is primarily a classification task. Thegoal is to predict whether a patient has experienced a stroke (1) or not (0) basedonvarious features. Details:
The objective of the Stroke Prediction Dataset is to classify whether individuals havehad a stroke (1) or not (0). Key features include age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, and BMI. The goal is
to predict stroke risk and identify associated factors using classification techniques
like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Suitable Machine Learning Algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression
Description: A statistical method for binary classification that models the
probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. Suitability: Simple and interpretable; good for understanding the influence of
each feature on stroke risk. Works well when the relationship between features
and the outcome is linear. 2. Decision Trees
Description: A model that splits data into branches to make predictions basedonfeature values.
Suitability: Easy to interpret and visualize. Handles both numerical and
categorical data well. Prone to overfitting, but useful for understanding featureimportance. 3. Random Forest
Description: An ensemble of decision trees that improves prediction accuracy by
averaging multiple trees. Suitability: Reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree. Good at handlinga mix of feature types and captures complex interactions between features. 4. Gradient Boosting
Description: An ensemble technique that builds trees sequentially, optimizing for
errors made by previous trees. Suitability: Highly effective for classification tasks with strong performance in
competitions. Handles missing data well and provides feature importance metrics. 5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Description: A non-parametric method that classifies a data point based on the
majority class of its nearest neighbors. Suitability: Simple and effective for small datasets. Performance can degrade withhigh dimensionality and larger datasets due to computational cost.
